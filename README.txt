MIExpert is a expert system for running molecular replacement
and refinement applications, and analyzing the data obtained
from high-throughput co-crystallography and fragment
screening projects.

Although it can be used separately, MIExpert is designed to
be used with MIFit, a cross-platform interactive graphics
application for molecular modeling, fitting, and refinement
of protein structures from x-ray crystallography.

The project web site for both MIExpert and MIFit is
http://code.google.com/p/mifit

MIExpert is licensed under the GNU GPL. See the license.txt
file for details.

Installation

  Extract the files from the MIExpert archive
  Run MIFit and open the MIExpert/setupJobMenu.py file

  The setupJobMenu.py script will configure the Job menu
  in MIFit. This step only needs to be done once.
